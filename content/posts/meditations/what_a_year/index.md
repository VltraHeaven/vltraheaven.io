After spending the better part of the last two years slowly installing linux on all the machines own (for some machines, more than once) and delving as deep as I could short of developing my own linux applilcatons (in due time...), I've decided to take the next step in my journey and prepare for the Red Hat Certified System Administrator exam. Since I'm more accustomed to using Arch, Debian and Void Linux based distributions from a user standpoint, I'm sure getting accustomed to RHEL and CentOS from a SysAdmin perspective will prove challenging. This post will act as a collection of all my notes from Sander van Vugt's 'Red Hat Certified System Administrator, 3rd Edition' video course and will hopefully be a useful resource for anyone else out there using the RHCSA as a vehicle to take the next step towards mastery in Linux.
